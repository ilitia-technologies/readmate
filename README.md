### `cli.py`

The `cli.py` module provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the Python project. It utilizes the `typer` library to define and handle command-line commands and options. This module contains the main function that parses the command-line arguments and executes the corresponding commands.


```python
# Example code snippet from the module
def main(
    output_dir: str = typer.Option(
        "readmate/json_output",
        "--output-dir",
        "-o",
        help="The path of the directory where we save the experiments",
    ),
    input_dir: str = typer.Option(
        "",
        "--input-dir",
        "-id",
        help="The path of the folder or zip file where the project is located",
    ),
    readme_only: bool = typer.Option(
        False,
        "--readme-only",
        help="Only generate the README file",
    ),
    token_count: int = typer.Option(
        0, 
        "--token-count", 
        "-tc", 
        help="The number of tokens to use")

):
    # This is the main function
    # It takes several command line arguments for customization
    
    # The 'output_dir' argument specifies the path of the directory where we save the experiments
    # The 'input_dir' argument specifies the path of the folder or zip file where the project is located
    # The 'readme_only' argument is a boolean flag indicating whether to only generate the README file
    
    # The function has several steps:
    # Step 1: Parse the command line arguments
    # Step 2: Set up the necessary configurations
    # Step 3: Perform the core functionality of the application
    # Step 4: Generate the README file
