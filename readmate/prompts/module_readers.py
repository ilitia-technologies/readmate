Readme Sections: {readme_section}
According to the next information about the module where this file is located: {non_module_file} and this portion or full text of the file: {file_info}, Obtain the following information:

'ReadmeSection': "In what section of the readme sections should this file be contained. Put None if the file should not be part of any section"
'Description': "A description of what this file does."
'CodeExtractions': "short snippet of the code,configuration,task... of the file. it should be based on the text read"
'Technologies' "Technologies or languages this file uses"
